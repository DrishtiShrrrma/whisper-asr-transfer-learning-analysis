# Things to Try

1. Fine-Tune Separately: fine-tune model on Danish first, and then further fine-tune on Norwegian and Swedish. This approach ensures that the model gains a deep understanding of Danish first and then extends its learning to similar languages.

2. Combine Datasets: create a mixed dataset with examples from Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. This would allow the model to learn the commonalities and differences between the languages simultaneously. You would have to ensure that the mixing is done in a way that allows the model to distinguish between the languages if that's relevant to the task.

3. Sequential Fine-Tuning: Start by pretraining on the combined dataset of all three languages to capture the common language structures. Then, fine-tune on the specific Danish dataset. Leverage the knowledge from related languages and then specialize the model for Danish.
